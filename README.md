# XSOverlay Notifier (UserPlugin version)

> [!NOTE]
> This is the UserPlugin version. You can find the regular plugin in your Vencord plugins page under "XSOverlay".

Sends Discord messages to [XSOverlay](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1173510/XSOverlay/) for easier viewing while using VR.

## Requests?
If you open an issue here I am more likely to see it. ONLY FOR THIS PLUGIN. Vencord stuff should go to one of their repos
